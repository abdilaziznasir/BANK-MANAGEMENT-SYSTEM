Project Title: Banking Management System

Project Overview:
The Banking Management System is a Java-based application that allows users to create and manage bank accounts. It provides functionalities such as creating new accounts, depositing and withdrawing funds, and viewing transaction history.

Project Structure:

BankAccount Class: Represents a bank account with attributes such as account number, password, balance, and transaction history. It includes methods for depositing, withdrawing, and validating the password.
BankingManagementSystem Class: Manages the overall banking system, including database connection, user interaction, and account creation.
Features Implemented:

Account Creation: Users can create new bank accounts by providing an account number and a password.
Deposit and Withdrawal: Account holders can deposit funds into their accounts and make withdrawals.
Transaction History: The system maintains a transaction history for each account, allowing users to view their past transactions.
Recent Update:

Enhancement: Added password strength validation to the account creation process to enforce a strong password policy.
Users are now prompted to enter a password that is at least 5 characters long and contains at least one lowercase letter, one uppercase letter, one number, and one special character.
This ensures that all newly created account passwords meet the specified criteria for strength and security.
